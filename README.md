# Name Standardization

This project aims to develop a standardized way of handling names and various naming conventions.

The focus will be on Western names and applications to names entered into Google Scholar or other academic databases.

This is **NOT** an attempt to uniquely identify people, but to uniquely identify names.  
For example, to correctly identify `Nicholas Anthony` and `Nick Anthony` and `Nick Anthony MS` as the same person.
